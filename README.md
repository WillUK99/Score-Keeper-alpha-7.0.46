### About

This is a small score keeper widget which can be used for 2 players. I utilized flexbox in this project to allow it to
be fully responsive on various screens. Both players can increment scores by 1 per click, with a built in reset button for the end of games, 
if a player changes the score limit mid-game then the scores will also be reset.

The overall styling is visually appealing with an imported font-family styling to give it more 
of an arcade feel.
